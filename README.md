## Usage

Upon opening the app, you will find a button that says Get Started. Once pressed, you will be taken to the note taking section! Here, you can give your note a title and write to your hearts content! Once finished, click the little save button at the top of the page to save your note to the side bar, where you will be able to pull it back up at the click of a button! Currently, there is a delete button but it is non functional, but hopefully i can get it working in the near future!
